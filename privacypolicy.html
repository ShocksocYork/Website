        <h4>Why do we collect your name and email address?</h4>
        <p>All you do by providing your name and email is simply give us permission to reply to your email and also allow us to make sure you are a member of shocksoc by referencing your email and name against our records of current members.</p>

        <h4>How is my data transferred and stored</h4>
        <p>All emails are sent to the official shocksoc@yusu.org email account directly through googles external SMTP protocol which encrypts the data using the TLS protocol (see below) keeping it safe during transfer.
        <br>No data is stored locally on the site. Discord links are deleted immediately once a reply is made and emails from the contact form are deleted once the query is believed to have been
        <br>resolved. The only exception is if we need to keep your email for reference for some reason. In which case we will always ask for your permission and if denied the email will be deleted anyway.</p>

        <h4>What about fake emails/users using a shocksoc email address as an alias</h4>
        <p>No one outside the university will ever recieve an email back as it requires a @york.ac.uk email address. No one outside the shocksoc member records will be sent an email.
        <br>If a user sends an email on behalf of another member without there consent the message will still be sent to the user but once it arrives the user will usually deny they have sent it.
        <br>In this scenario if requested, there email can be blacklisted against recieving any further requests from any forms on the site to prevent spam. Note that this kind of behaviour is
        not acceptable and if definitive proof is provided that an email has been sent in this way from a another user a further review may be sent to YUSU or the student body president of Electronics.</p>

        <h4>What can I include in the contact form message</h4>
        <p>Be aware that everyone within shocksoc leadership roles will be able to read your message from the shocksoc@yusu.org email address so make sure to use common sense when structuring your messages.
        <br>For example you shouldn't include any sensitive information such as passwords, your student id number or your address in the contact form.
        <br>We will never request this kind of information. As a user it is your responsibility to check this.</p>

        <h4>What is SMTP, SSL and TLS? Will it keep my communications absolutely secure?</h4>
        <p>STMP stands for 'simple mail transfer protocol'. It is a system designed to send electronic emails between servers.
        <br>SSL and TLS are encryption protocols that ensures a fully secured communication for all data exchanged.
        <br>These systems are widely used to ensure fully secured communications over the internet. </p>
