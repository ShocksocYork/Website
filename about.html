          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Shocksoc is the <u>university of Yorks official Electronics society.</u>
          <br> We aim to give everyone at the university a platform to learn more about electronics and socialise/interact with other like minded individuals.
          <br><u>We welcome anyone interested in electronics</u>, not just Electronics students, so if you in the mood for experimenting or trying something new feel free to come along.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "infoArticle">
          <h3>Labs</h3>
          <p>Labs occour between 2-5pm in the top floor of the Electronics building (Big black ominous thing). Anyone is free to come along no matter what your current levels of experience are.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "infoArticle">
          <h3>Membership</h3>
          <p>All new and <u>existing Electronics students can become a member for FREE.</u>
          <br>Just visit the links on our front page.
          <br><u>Students outside of Electronics must pay £4</u> as an initial fee to sign up but this will last for the rest of the year and we believe is reasonable considering what we offer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "infoArticle">
          <h3>Events</h3>
          <p>For 2019 we aim to offer a wide range and number of different events with our first this year starting off very early with our <u>involvement in the viking raid</u>. 
          <br>Previous events have included Lab/study sessions (sometimes complete with pizza), the now famous Dress Like John social and our year long Wednesday Robot Wars competition & labs.
          <br>For information on whats to come this year <u>check our facebook events page or simply the ‘events’ tab</u> on the site.</p>

          <h3>Gaming</h3>
          <p><u>New for 2019.</u>
          <br>Our gaming section of Shocksoc offers a laid back atmosphere <u>very different to other major gaming societies such as Fragsoc</u> who game competitively.
          <br>Anyone is welcome no matter their ability. Since this is new for this year we are <u>still figuring out what’s going to happen</u> but we will aim to ask the members for opinions on different games you want to see pop up on Shocksocs radar.
          <br><u>Our first server of 2019 is a 1.14 Minecraft server</u> which can be accessed through our discord or through emailing shocksoc@yusu.org with your IGN to add you to the whitelist. I.P: mc.shocksoc.org</u></p>
